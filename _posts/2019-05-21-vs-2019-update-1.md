The latest VS 2019 Redistribution packages are available ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe)), as well as the Remote Debugging Tools ([x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.x86ret.enu.exe), [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/RemoteTools.amd64ret.enu.exe)). For more on Visual Studio 2019 Update 1, see the release notes.

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

VS 2019 Update 1 includes a new version of the C/C++ compiler (19.21.27702). This includes some new C++20 draft language and library features and other bug fixes. See [Microsoft Docs](https://ocs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/overview/cpp-conformance-improvements?view=vs-2019#improvements_161) for details.

The C/C++ Runtime (14.21.27702) is included in this update. Remember that VS 2015, VS 2017, and VS 2019 share the same runtime redistributable binaries and are 'binary compatible'.

<strong>Known Issue</strong>: There is a known issue for both VS 2019 RTM and VS 2019 Update 1 when using my Direct3D Game project templates on [GitHub](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-vs-templates/releases). If you have VS 2017 installed as well, it works. Otherwise you need to edit your ``devenv.exe.config``. See [here](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/572125/visual-studio-2019-doesnt-handle-14000-assembly-re.html) for the details.

<strong>clang</strong>: VS 2019 Update 1 includes integration support for clang/LLVM using [CMake](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-studio-cmake-support-clang-llvm-cmake-3-14-vcpkg-and-performance-improvements/) as an 'individual component'. For details, see [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clang-llvm-support-in-visual-studio/).

<strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux:</strong> For more information on WSL, see [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c-with-visual-studio-2019-and-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl).
